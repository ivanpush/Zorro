Pathway overrepresentation was analyzed using the hypergeometric distribution. This was performed using the hypergeom.cdf() function from the SciPy Python library. The p-value that a pathway is overrepresented was computed as the probability that a given cluster (or group of confirmed hits for a given cell type) contains at least the observed number compounds affecting that pathway when drawing groups of the observed size randomly without replacement under the null hypothesis that pathways are evenly distributed throughout the population.",

Scale bars represent 25 \u03bcm. (b) Implementation of FLECS Technology in a 384 well-plate format. (c) Workflow for image analysis: Input includes aligned image sets of the micropatterns (set 1) and stained cell nuclei (set 2). Analysis involves (i) identification and measurement of all micropatterns in image set 1, (ii) cross-referencing the positions of each micropattern in image set 2, and (iii) determining the presence of 0, 1, or >2 nuclei (cells). Output consists of mean center-to-terminal displacements of micropatterns containing a single nucleus (one cell), compared to the median measurement of non-displaced patterns with zero nuclei. The resulting differences are presented as a horizontal histogram. MATLAB code enabling describing original versions of these algorithms are described in a previous work[16].

MYO cells were imaged at a single 24-hour time point to capture their response to TGF-\u03b2, which aligns with the biological timescale of myofibroblast activation. In contrast, SMCs were imaged pre-drug exposure, and at 45 minutes and 2 hours post-drug exposure to capture their acute responses. Hit definitions were established based on these time points. For comparison, SMCs were also screened at 24 hours; however, hits from this time point were not selected for further analysis as the focus remained on acute responses.
