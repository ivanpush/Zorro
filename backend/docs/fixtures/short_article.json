We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 48 healthy adults who underwent 24 hours of sleep deprivation. Participants received either 200mg caffeine or placebo before completing a battery of working memory tasks. Caffeine significantly improved performance on the n-back task (p < 0.001) and reduced reaction time variability.
